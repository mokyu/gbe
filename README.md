# gbe

Something i made a long time ago.

## "Features"
• Partially implemented interrupts

• CPU ming is a bit off I think?

• No audio

• No controls

• Runs the gb bios rom pretty much flawlessly

• No support for memory bank switching afaik

• It runs some of Blargg's Gameboy hardware test ROMs i think.

• Comes with a bugger written using ncurses

## usage

build with `sdl2` and `ncurses` on your run of the mill GNU/Linux installation

place `bios.gb` and `rom.gb` in the same directory. before running `gbe`.
